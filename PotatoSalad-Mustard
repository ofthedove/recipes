# Mustard Potato Salad
Mom's classic mustard potato salad, perfect with burgers or brats. Eat it hot or cold. Great for picnics and potlucks.

## Ingredients
* Russet Potatoes
* Diced Vidalia Onion
* Diced Celery
* Diced Dill Pickles
* Butter
* Mayonaise
* Mustard
* Salt
* Pepper
* Other seasonings to taste

## Directions
Peel and boil the potatoes in salted water. Once tender remove from heat and strain.

Melt butter into potatoes then add all other ingredients. Mash and combine. Season to taste.

## Note
You'll notice there are no quantities on this recipe. That is intentional. Potato salad is a flexible dish, the kind where everything is "to taste".

That's not terribly helpful though, so here:

The last time I made it I used about 8-10 medium/large potatoes. I used half a small, fresh vidalia onion (the sweet and mild vidalia is preferred as the onion will be uncooked) and half a large celery stalk. I used probably 20+ medium dill chips; more pickle than the onion or celery. I used 3 ish tablespoons of butter, about a quarter cup or more of mayo, and about half as much mustard. I seasoned with pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and a little thyme b/c why not. I salted the boil water but mine needed more salt in the end. I also used a little milk to get it to the right consistency. I felt like those proportions worked well, but again, feel free to do whatever. It's potato salad, it's really hard to screw up.
