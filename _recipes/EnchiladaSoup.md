title: Enchilada Soup
---

This started as a harebrained experiment but it turned out really nice, Thia liked it, and I expect I'll make it again. It's not too far off of Chicken Tortilla Soup, though it's been so long now I couldn't tell you how close it is exactly.

It started because I was making J Kenji Lopez-Alt's enchiladas recipe [(Serious Eats link)](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-chicken-enchiladas-recipe) 

Had extra chicken
cooked it, made broth, made soup
Used veggie -> Starch -> cheese sauce from broccoli soup, but this time with beans and pepper jack

It's not hot, but it has a warmth that builds. Can serve with corn chips, but don't have to. Could also serve with crema (or sour cream) if you want to cut the heat a little extra.

## Ingredients
- White onion
- 2 (ish) serrano
- Garlic
- Oil (or chicken grease, if you have it from cooking the chicken)
- Chicken broth
- 1 can refried beans (I used Rosarita traditional this time)
- 1 can (28oz) Green Chili Enchilada Sauce (I used Las Palmas Mild Green this time)
- Canned Chili Beans (I used 1 ea: mixed chili beans, chili beans, pinto beans, hot chili beans, black beans, all Great Value brand)
- Chicken, cooked
- 1 can Corn
- 2 cans (10oz ea) Rotel (I used GV brand)
- 1 bag Pepper Jack (I think it was one of those 2 cup bags? Idk whatever size Aldi sells. More is good!)
- Milk (This was _probably_ a mistake, see notes)


## Instructions
0. I fried bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs seasoned with salt and pepper, separated the meat from the bones, shredded and cut the meat, saved the grease, and boiled the bones and skins to make broth. (I also added chicken bullion to the broth, _always_ add chicken bullion.) I don't reccomend this, but I was cooking the chicken anyway for something else. That also means that, while I used about 2lb ish worth of meat (weight raw w/ bone and skin included, remember that), I had the bones and skins from all 6 lb for broth. Just, put some bullion in hot water, it'll be fine. The mouth feel from real broth is nice and all but it's not gonna make that much difference with everything piled on top.

1. Chop the onion and serrano and cook in the fat. Mince the garlic and add it.
2. When that smells nice, and I went so far as to get some color on it, dunno if that's good or not, then add the broth. Go ahead and add the refried beans and the enchilada sauce too. Let it get warmed up some so the beans will blend easier.
3. Use an immersion blender to get the refried beans blended in nicely. Aim to smooth up any pieces of onion or pepper too, and get the whole thing to a nice consistency. Even with the fat from frying the onions, there shouldn't be any grease on top, getting an emulsion or whatever is the point of blending in the beans.
4. Dump in the beans. All the beans. (Drain the pintos, include juice with the others.) Let it get up to a simmer for a bit. Doesn't need long, everything is cooked.
5. Add the chicken, corn, and rotel. Maybe bring it back to a simmer, but if so, barely. Then kill the heat and let it start coasting down. You don't want grainy cheese.
6. When it's not too hot, add the pepperjack and mix it in

## Notes
On my first cook, I did some things I wouldn't repeat:
- I added the corn and rotel after the cheese. The rotel would have been better if it had gotten just a touch more cooked. I wanted it to add freshness, but Thia felt the tomato was a bit too raw.
- I added some milk with the cheese. I wanted to make the sauce a little more white. All the chili bean sauce pushed it a little toward red/brown. I also wanted it to have that kinda mellow/soft vibe of a white chicken chili or other milk based soup. But, because I added the milk after the cheese, I couldn't bring it to a simmer after without risking breaking the cheese, and I've heard it's usually best to bring soups/sauces with milk to a simmer after adding the milk before serving. Next time I would add the milk earlier, bring it to a simmer, then bring it down for the cheese. I might also use more milk, or a little cream or something, to get it even richer. You could even replace some of the broth with milk, to push it more towards a cheese soup.

Add the meat late. If you use chicken breast instead of thighs, _definitely_ don't add it too early. Boiled chicken is gross, and you don't want the flavor going out of the meat into the soup, you got all the flavor you need from the broth/bullion. Keep the flavor in the meat.
