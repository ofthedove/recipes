Babish's classic pancake recipe https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/classicpancakes

## Ingredients
* 10 oz flour
* 3 Tbsp sugar
* 4 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 large eggs
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for the pan
* 1 1/2 cups whole milk
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)
* Butter and syrup for serving

## Instructions
In one bowl, combine dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk to combine

In another bowl, combine eggs, vegetable oil, and whole milk. Optional: you can also add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract here. Whisk to combine.

Combine the two bowls and mix together gently with a rubber spatula. The batter should still be lumpy with a few dry streaks of flour. Don't overmix the pancakes!

Cover the batter and let it rest at room temperature for 10 minutes.

Heat 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil in a nonstick skillet.

Ladle one scoop of batter into the skillet and cook for a few minutes. Once bubbles appear on the surface and around the edge of the pancake, cook and flip for a few minutes more.

Stack your pancakes up and serve with syrup and butter if desired. Enjoy!
