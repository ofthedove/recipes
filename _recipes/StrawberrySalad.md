title: Strawberry Salad

This strawberry tossed salad has long been a family favorite. If I recall correctly, Erica is responsible for orignally popularizing the recipe way back in Livermore.

The dressing used here can also be used on a wide variety of other salads.

## Ingredients
### Dressing
- 1/2 cup canola oil

- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon paprika (optional)

Note: The ingredients for this recipe are rarely measured with any precision, feel free to tweak as you see fit.

## Instructions
### Dressing
Combine ingredients in a jar and shake

Note: I've also used an immersion blender on this to get a more thorough mix, and I quite liked the results. Also lets you skip mincing the garlic.

### Salad
Make a salad. It's not rocket science.
