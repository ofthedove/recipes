title: Potato Candy
---

## Ingredients
- 1 small Potato
- Powdered Sugar
- Peanut Butter

### Instructions.
- Clean, peel, cut, and boil the potato. Just as if you were going to make mashed potatoes
- Drain the potato and put it in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix in powdered sugar until a dough is formed
- The texture of the dough is very important. Lean a little on the sticky side. It will be harder to roll out flat, but if it's too dry it won't roll up without cracking. The dough can be wetted with a few drops of water or dried by working in more sugar.
- Roll out the dough into a rectangle
- Spread peanut butter across the dough
- Roll the dough up like a cinnamon roll
- Carefully cut the roll into small circles
