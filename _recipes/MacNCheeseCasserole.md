- 1/4 cup chopped Onion
- 1 Tb Butter
- 1 Tb AP Flour

- 1 1/4 cup Milk
- 2 cup Cheese (8oz)
- Ritz crackers and butter for topping

## Instructions
Cook macaroni and drain well
Cook onion in butter till tender but not brown. Stir in flour and seasoning. Add milk all at once. Cook and stir till slightly thickened and bubbly. Add shredded cheese, stir till melted

Bake, uncovered, in a 350 oven for 25 or 30 min or till bubbly.

## Notes

- Don't make just one! The amounts here will serve only 4. Tripling the recipe should fill an 9x13 casserole, but quadrupling gives better "round" numbers.
- A blend of American, cheddar, and cream cheese is typically used. Even ratio should work well, but can be adjusted depending on how much is being made.
- [This recipe from Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-bechamel-baked-mac-cheese-recipe) is basically the same, with more details and a couple extra suggestoins:
    - Reserve a portion of the shredded cheese and add it after removing from the heat to get some stretchy-ness in the final casserole
    - Use panko instead of cracker crumbs for extra crispy goodness
- Serious Eats also has another version of the recipe using sodium citrate rather than a bechemel, find it [here](https://www.seriouseats.com/sodium-citrate-baked-mac-and-cheese)
