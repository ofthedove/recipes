A classic, evergreen dessert. Basically yellow cake fried in butter and sugar. What's not to love?

While I've been making this forever, I referenced [BettyCrocker.com](https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/easy-pineapple-upside-down-cake) to get specific quantities. That said, feel free to measure with your heart.

## Ingredients

* 1 box (13.25 oz) Yellow Cake Mix
* Water, oil/butter, and eggs as per cake mix directions
* 1 can (20oz) pineapple slices in juice
* 10 ish maraschino cherries
* 1/2 stick (1/4 cup) Butter
* 1 cup ish Brown Sugar

## Instructions

* Preheat a cast iron skillet in the oven. (350F)
* Separate the pineapple slices from the juice, RETAIN the juice!
* Make the cake mix according to package directions, except use the pineapple juice in place of the water. You may need to add some water to get to the directed amount.
* Remove the preheated skillet from the oven, add the butter, and allow it to melt fully. Sprinkle brown sugar into the skillet to cover the base. Lay pineapple slices in the skillet, and place a cherry in the center of each slice
* Pour cake batter into the skillet and bake about 45 min, until cake is fully cooked through
* Remove the skillet and cool only a couple minutes, just to let the cake firm up a bit. Then, place a plate over the skillet and flip, allowing the cake to fall onto the plate
* Serve warm or cool, store refrigerated.

## Notes

* For an easier-to-slice cake, cut the pineapple rings in half and arrange them in a circle. Also cut the cherries in half, and place a half cherry in each half hole.
* The Betty Crocker recipe says to use 325 for a dark pan, but I like the edges a little crispy. I don't remember what I've done in the past.
* I've never once measured the brown sugar, just put on an amount that looks good. Same with the butter to some extent
