title: Short Rib Cottage Pie
---

This is kinda a combo of the Basics with Babish short rib and cottage pie recipes, with my own twist. We quite like it.

## Ingredients
### Braised Short Ribs
- Beef short ribs, 3-4 pieces
- 1 onion, roughly chopped
- 1 celary stalk, roughly chopped (optional)
- 1 carrot, peeled and roughly chopped (optional)
- 6-8 cloves garlic
- 1-2 Tbsp tomato paste
- Thyme, Rosemary, Bay leaves, Salt, and Pepper to taste

### Mashed Potatoes
- 1.5 lb Yukon Gold potatoes
- 1/2 stick butter
- Milk or Cream
- 4-6 oz Aged White Cheddar

### Gravy
- Cornstarch
- Cold water

### Vegetables
1 bag mixed frozen vegetables (corn, peas, carrots, and green beans)

## Instructions
Season the short ribs genrously with salt and pepper on all sides. Sear on all sides, returning to the same spot in the pan to prevent the fond from burning. Remove short ribs from the pan and set aside, add chopped onion and cook until they begin to develop color. Add celery and carrot (optional) and cook briefly. Add garlic, herbs, and tomato paste and cook until fragrent. Deglaze with water or broth, then add remaining water or broth. If using water, add beef bullion. Return short ribs to pot.

If braising, cook until short ribs offer no resistence to a pairing knife and are falling off the bone, 3-4 hours. If presssure cooking, cook on high pressure for 45 min, followed by 15 min natural release.

While braising, wash and cut potatoes and boil until tender. Add butter and milk/cream to achieve a smooth consistency. Add cheese such that it melts evenly into the potatoes. Salt and pepper to taste.

Remove short ribs and set aside. Strain solids from beef broth, retaining broth. (Optionally skim fat from broth.) Return broth to pan and reduce by approx 1/2. Remove bones and connective tissue from short ribs. Shred short rib meat.

Once broth has reduced, in a seperate bowl combine cornstarch with cold water. Slowly add corstarch mixture to broth until broth thickens to gravy. (Recall that gravy will thicken as it cools.) Salt and pepper to taste.

In a pie plate, add vegetables and meat. Pour gravy on top until not quite covering meat and vegetables. (Too much gravy will make a mess in the oven.) Spoon potatoes on top. Bake at 300F for 10-15 min, until vegetables are cooked. Then broil for 5-10 min until the top begins to brown. Let stand for approx 10 min then serve.
