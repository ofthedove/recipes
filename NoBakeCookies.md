# No Bake Cookies
I don't think there's much variation in recipes for no bake cookies, but this is one I used recently. It has peanut butter in it!

From https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/peanut-butter-chocolate-no-bake-cookies-recipe-2015085

## Ingredents
2 C Sugar
1/2 C Milk
1 Stick Butter
1/4 C Cocoa Powder
3 C Old-Fashioned Oats
1 C Peanut Butter
1 Tb Vanilla
1 Pinch Kosher Salt

## Instructions
Prepare parchment paper on a baking sheet

Bring sugar, milk, butter, and cocoa to a boil in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Let boil for 1 minute. Remove from heat and add oats, peanut butter, vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Stir to combine.

Drop scoops of the mixture onto the parchment and allow to cool.

(Recipe says to refrigerate for up to 3 days. I kept them at room temp and ate on them for over a week. It's _probably_ fine.)
