Gordon Ramsey's Sausage Rice, from [A Glug of Oil](https://www.aglugofoil.com/2012/10/spicy-sausage-rice-recipe-gordon-ramsay.html?m=1). This is an oft-made weeknight staple. The flavor can be varied significantly by changing the sausage used.

## Ingredients
- 1 Tb Oil
- 1 red onion, thinly sliced
- 1 red pepper, large dice (Optional, we always leave this out)
- 2 garlic cloves, finely sliced (I use frozen minced)
- 1 lb ground sausage, or 6 sausages removed from casings. Usually hot italian
- 1 t smoked paprika (heaped/heavy)
- 200g Jasmine rice
- 1/3 cup dry white wine (I often substitute stock or water)
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 4 green onions, sliced.
- 2 tomatoes, roughly chopped
- small bunch of flat leaf parsley, roughly chopped

## Instructions
- In a heavy pot or dutch oven, fry the onion in the oil until soft but not colored, about 5 min
- Add pepper (optional) and garlic and cook, about 2 min.
  - (The white portion of the green onions can also be added here)
- Crumble the sausage, roughly the size of small meatballs, and add.
- Raise the heat to brown the sausage. (Aim for color, don't just steam it.) About 4-5 min.
- Add paprika and the rice. Mix rice in thoroughly.
- Deglaze with the wine. (Add the wine and gently scrape the bottom of the pan.)
- Add the stock and bring to a boil.
- Reduce to a simmer and cook, without a lid, stirring occasionally, until rice is tender, 15-20 min.
- When rice is soft, remove from heat, taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
- Gently fold in green onions, tomato, and parsley. Serve immediately after adding fresh veggies.
