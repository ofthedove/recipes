title: Meatloaf - Mom's Classic
---
Mom's classic meatloaf.

I got the original recipe from Mom, but it's changed a bit over time. I tried to include the changes here, but it may not be exact.

For example, I feel like I remember using less oatmeal, and it may be better to use 2 eggs for 3lb of meat. Italian sausage is a later addition and can be omitted, but we liked the way it tasted. Ketchup is measured only with the heart, never with a measuring cup, so I have no idea if that value is accurate, but it seems right ish. I didn't even attempt to put measurements on the seasonings. Good luck!

## Ingredients
- 2 lb ground beef
- 1 lb hot italian sausage
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 Egg
- 1 c oatmeal
- 1 c Ketchup
- Salt
- Pepper
- Garlic powder

## Instructions
Mix it all together, shape into a loaf, top with additional ketchup, and bake it in a roasting pan. Try to avoid over-mixing, this meatloaf is usually fall-apart-y.
