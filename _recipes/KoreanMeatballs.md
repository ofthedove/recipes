Inspired by a couple Hello Fresh meals, this version uses pre-made meatballs for a super low-effort weeknight meal.

Also I haven't actually made it yet this is meal planning we'll see how it goes. !UpdateMe!

## Sauce

### Bulgogi Sauce
Hello Fresh gives you pre-made Bulgogi.
This Bulgogi recipe is from here: https://www.chilipeppermadness.com/recipes/bulgogi-sauce/

It claims it's for 4 servings.

Combine:
- 4 T soy sauce
- 2 T gochujang
- 2 T rice wine vinegar
- 2 T sesame oil
- 1 T honey (can sub brown sugar)
- 1 t fresh chopped ginger (I'll use 1 puck frozen)
- 3 cloves minced garlic (I'll use 3 frozen pucks)
- 1 T red pepper flakes
- Black pepper
- Optional: 1 spicy red pepper minced for extra heat

Hello Fresh also reccomends a drizzle sauce for the bulgogi meatballs. Just combine sour cream, sriracha, and water to taste.

### Firecracker Sauce
This is for 2 servings, direct from Hello Fresh. Multiply as needed.

Combine:
- 2 T Mayo
- 1.5 T Sour Cream
- 2 t Honey
- 2 t soy sauce
- 1 t Sriracha

## Meatballs
Heat the pre-cooked meatballs as directed. Toss in sauce.

To make the meatballs from scratch, see here for Bulgogi: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/meatballs-with-bulgogi-sauce-663bd4b4fe8a253ad9a7b400

Or here for firecracker: https://www.hellofresh.com/recipes/firecracker-meatballs-65e89a53ad357710d5d54bf6

I'm sure they're better made from scratch but we're aiming for low-effort here.

## Rice
Hello Fresh reccomends adding some ginger to the rice for flavor.

## Veggies
I'll serve with garlic and ginger pan fried green beans. They're really good.

I've made them a few times before, they're not really a recipe thing, just throw some frozen garlic and ginger in the pan with some oil, when it smells good add the green beans and cook. Try to get some color on them if you can.

Roast Broccoli or Carrots would also be good alternatives.
