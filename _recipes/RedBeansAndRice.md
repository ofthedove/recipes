title: Red Beans and Rice
---

I recently saw red beans and rice on reddit and decided I wanted to make some. It happened that we went to Joel and Rachael's houes the night I was going to make this, so I made it there! (Thia did the prep work for me before we left.) It turned out really well I think.

I was inspired by this Reddit Post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/DixieFood/comments/tqesrs/red_beans_and_rice_forgot_the_green_onions/

That linked to this recipe:

I also looked at this recipe:
https://damndelicious.net/2019/04/15/red-beans-and-rice/

Ultimately I didn't follow either recipe exactly though.

## Ingredients
- 1 small pyrex (~1pt I think) chopped onion
- 1 small pyrex chopped green onion
- 1 small pyrex chopped celery
- A bunch of minced garlic
- 1 Squeeze Tomato Paste
- 1 pkg Andouille Sausage
- 4 cans Red Beans
- Chicken Better than Bouillon
- Oil
- Rice
- Seasonings
- Hot sauce
- Green Onion

## Instructions
Slice the sausage into thin rings and fry it, just enough to get a little color on it.

Fry the trinity in a little oil. Start the green pepper a little early, it takes longer to cook down.

Add the garlic and tomato paste, cook until fragrent. Quickly add chicken stock or water with bouillon.

Add back the sausage. Drain, rinse, and add the beans. Season to taste with Cajun Seasoning (Or whatever sounds good.)

While the beans simmer and cook-down a little, prepare the rice. 

Serve over rice topped with green onion and hot sauce.
