<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>cups all-purpose flour (9 ounces; 225g)</li>
  <li>1/4 cup Sugar (1.75 ounces; 50g)</li>
  <li>3 1/2 teaspoons Baking Powder</li>
  <li>3/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt; for table salt use half as much by volume</li>
  <li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li>
  <li>1/4 cup (60 ml) neutral oil such as vegetable or canola oil, or melted butter, plus extra for greasing the skillet</li>
  <li>1 1/3 cups (315 ml) whole milk, room temperature</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract, optional</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>n a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together until combined. In a medium bowl, whisk eggs, oil, milk and vanilla (if using) until well combined. Pour egg mixture into flour mixture and with a whisk, stir gently until just combined (batter should remain lumpy with a few streaks of flour). Let batter sit for 10 to 15 minutes before cooking.</li>
  <li>In a 12-inch nonstick skillet, heat 1 teaspoon oil over medium-low heat until shimmering, 5 minutes. Using paper towels, carefully wipe out excess oil, leaving thin film on bottom and sides of skillet.</li>
  <li><strong>To Test Temperature of Skillet:</strong> Drop 1 tablespoon batter in center of skillet. If pancake is pale golden brown after 1 minute, skillet is ready. If it is too light or too dark, adjust heat accordingly.</li>
  <li>Using 1/4-cup dry measuring cup or ice cream scoop, portion batter into skillet in 3 places, leaving even spacing between portions. Use the back of a measuring cup or a spoon to gently spread batter into a 4-inch round. Cook until bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, edges are set, and bottom sides are golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
  <li>Using a thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and continue to cook until the second sides are golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and serve. (Alternatively transfer cooked pancakes to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and hold warm in a 200℉; 93℃ oven until ready to serve.) Repeat with remaining batter, using additional oil as needed.</li>
</ol>
