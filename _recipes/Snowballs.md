These are a holiday tradition. The recipe comes from "So Quick with New Bisquick" where they're called Pecan Tea Cookies. This cookbook, published in 1967, is a real classic in our house, even if it is a bit dated.

## Ingredients
* 1 cup New Bisquick
* 1/4 cup soft butter
* 1/4 cup chopped pecans
* 1 Tbsp sugar
* 1/2 tsp almond extract or vanilla
* 2 Tbsp boiling water
* 1 Tbsp granulated sugar
* Confectioners' sugar

## Instructions
Heat oven to 375
Mix Bisquick, butter, pecans, granulated sugar and extract. Add water and mix vigorously with fork until dough forms a ball and cleans bowl.
Shape dough into 1-inch balls. Place on ungreased baking sheet and bake about 12 minutes or until lightly browned.
While warm, roll each cookie in confectioners' sugar. Makes 2 dozen.
