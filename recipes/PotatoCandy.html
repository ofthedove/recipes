<p>It may sound crazy, but it’s super tasty! No one really knows for sure where it came from but it seems to be popular mostly only in and around the Appalachian region. Our family has been making it for as long as I can remember.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 small Potato</li>
  <li>Powdered Sugar</li>
  <li>Peanut Butter</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions.</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Clean, peel, cut, and boil the potato. Just as if you were going to make mashed potatoes</li>
  <li>Drain the potato and put it in the bowl of a stand mixer. Mix in powdered sugar until a dough is formed</li>
  <li>The texture of the dough is very important. Lean a little on the sticky side. It will be harder to roll out flat, but if it’s too dry it won’t roll up without cracking. The dough can be wetted with a few drops of water or dried by working in more sugar.</li>
  <li>Roll out the dough into a rectangle</li>
  <li>Spread peanut butter across the dough</li>
  <li>Roll the dough up like a cinnamon roll</li>
  <li>Carefully cut the roll into small circles</li>
</ul>
