A classic comfort side dish usually enjoyed at Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. This recipe comes from Mom's Better Homes and Gardens cook book, with several tweaks.

Note: Don't make just one! The amounts here will serve only 4. Tripling the recipe should fill an 9x13 casserole, but quadrupling gives better "round" numbers.

Note: A blend of American, cheddar, and cream cheese is typically used. Even ratio should work well, but can be adjusted depending on how much is being made.
