# Red Sauce
This is the red sauce Babish makes in the Sauces episode of Basics with Babish. I made it with with sausage and served it on spaghetti, it went really well.

## Ingredients
* 1/4 cup Olive Oil
* 3 cloves Minced Garlic
* 1 Yellow Onion, Chopped
* Orageno (to taste)(optional)
* Red Pepper Flakes (to taste)(optional)
* few Tablespoons Tomato Paste
* 2 28 oz cans Tomatos (San Marzano preferred)
* sprig Fresh Basil
* few T Butter (unsalted)

## Instructions
Heat olive oil to shimmering, add garlic and, optionally, oregano and red pepper flake. Saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add onion and cook until soft, several minutes. Add tomato paste, stir, and cook briefly. Add tomatoes, crushing against side of pot. Add basil and stir. Bring to a bare simmer and cook over low heat at least one hour. Remove basil. Add butter, allowing it to melt and stirring it in. Salt and pepper to taste.

## Variation - Sausage
Before starting sauce, cook 1 lb crumbled italian sausage. Set the sausage aside, and use the fat left in pan in place of a portion of the olive oil. (Add olive oil to bring the total fat in the pan to 1/4 cup.) Re-add the sausage before simmering the sauce, or serve alongside the finished sauce.

## Note
The recommended cooking vessel for this dish is an enameled dutch oven. Seasoned pans, such as bare cast iron or carbon steel, are not recommended for simmering tomatoes.
