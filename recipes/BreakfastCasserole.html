<p>The classic Christmas morning casserole, plus some variations. The base recipe is very similar to <a href="/recipes/recipes/HashbrownCasserole.html">Hashbrown Casserole</a></p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 bag hashbrowns</li>
  <li>1 can cream of mushroom soup (The small one)</li>
  <li>8 oz sour cream</li>
  <li>Shredded cheese (Rarely measured, probably 1-2 cups)</li>
  <li>1 lb breakfast sausage, cooked</li>
  <li>8 eggs, beaten</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<h3 id="day-before">Day Before</h3>
<p>Mix hashbrowns, cream of mushroom, sour cream, and shredded cheese
Spread into a 9x13 (ish) casserole dish
Scatter sausage accross the top
Store casserole in the refrigerator</p>

<h3 id="morning-of">Morning Of</h3>
<p>Preheat oven to 350
Beat eggs and pour accross the top of the casserole
Bake until eggs are set. (Shake slightly, if center jiggles, keep cooking.)
Remove, allow to cool, serve warm.</p>

<h2 id="variations">Variations</h2>
<p>All measurements are approximate and can be adjusted to taste.</p>

<p>Either shredded or cubed potatoes can be used. Fresh potatoes can be used in place of frozen.</p>

<p>If fresh potatoes are used, consider boiling them briefly in water with some white vinegar added. This will cause them to hold their shape much better in the finished casserole</p>

<p>Extra cheese can be added on top of the eggs.</p>

<h3 id="slow-cooker">Slow Cooker</h3>
<p>Instead of baking the casserole in the morning, the whole thing can be assembled in a slow cooker and cooked overnight so it’s ready in the morning with no extra prep.</p>

<p>Do be mindful that with this method there is a significant difference between using frozen hashbrowns with room temp cream of mushroom vs freshly par-boiled potatoes and freshly cooked gravy. In the latter case, the higher starting temp improves food safety as the casserole gets up to temp much faster, but means the casserole is more likely to overcook if allowed to run all night.</p>

<h3 id="sausage-gravy">Sausage Gravy</h3>
<p>The cream of mushroom soup and sour cream can be replaced with a white gravy made using the grease from the sausage.</p>

<p>When the casserole is made for Christmas, it’s often made together with the hashbrown casserole, so using cream of mushroom for both is simpler as they can be prepped together. However, when breakfast casserole is made on it’s own, the extra effort to prepare a sausage gravy is often worth it.</p>

<h3 id="inverted">Inverted</h3>
<p>In this variation, place the potatoes in the casserole alone and pour the eggs in. Scatter cheese on potatoes then spread the sausage and gravy accross the top and sprinkle on a little extra cheese. This creates a similar but significantly different texture. Just be sure to season the eggs appropriately to also season the potatoes as they cook.</p>
