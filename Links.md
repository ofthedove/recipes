# Links
Links to things that will probably end up in this repo, but I either haven't made yet or havent typed up yet.

## Stubs

Random little things

### Cole Slaw

I kinda tried this recipe. I got a bag of cole slaw mix from Walmart but didn't have dressing, and looking for a dressing recipe brought me to this. I tried the sugar and salt soak but it didn't pull much water out, probably because the pre-cut mix was already drained or treated somehow. I do want to try this again sometime. I might try it soon, I want to get more cabbage into my diet.
