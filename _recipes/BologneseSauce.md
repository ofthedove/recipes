## Ingredients

* 1 large Red Onion
* Oil
* 3 lb Ground Chuck (alt. Sirloin or Lamb) 
* 1 lb Chicken Livers
* 1 can (6 oz) Tomato Paste
* 1 bottle White Wine
* 3 cans (28 oz ea) Crushed Tomatoes (Use only high quality tomatoes.)
* 1 big spoonful (2-4 tablespoons?) Liquid Chicken Bouillon
* 1T ea Basil, Parsley, Orageno
* < 1T Thyme
* Garlic Powder (to taste)
* Pepper (to taste)
* 1/4 cup Balsamic Vinegar 

## Instructions
Clean and dice carrots and onion. (Use food processor if available.) Add oil to dutch oven and fry carrot and onion on high heat. Stir regularly. Remove from pan and set aside when soft.

Oil pan and add ground meat. Break up to fine consistency. Cook on high heat, stirring constantly, until water evaporates and meat fries. (May take 20 min or more.)

Process chicken livers till not quite smooth and add to meat. Add tomato paste. Cook until fond is about to burn, then deglaze with white wine. Re-add vegetables. Add tomatoes and bouillon.

Bring to a slow simmer ("burble") and cook for 2 hours, stirring every 15 min. Add vinegar and seasonings. (Basil, parsley, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, and pepper.) Cook for an additional hour, stirring every 15 min.

Boil pasta and adjust final seasonings. (Remember sauce should be slightly over seasoned to season pasta.) Add sauce to pasta and add fresh parsley. Plate, top with cheese, add olive oil drizzle to side.

Alternatively, combine sauce and cream in a pan and boil until thickened, then add pasta and fresh basil.

To store, freeze in ice cube trays then transfer to freezer bag. When reheating after freezing, add a dash of vinegar to revitalize.
