title: Cooked Icing
---

This classic tops every properly prepared red velvet cake

This recipe is technically a 1.5x of the original recipe, in order to make enough for a torted 4 layer cake with icing between each layer. For a two layer cake, use 2/3 the amounts listed

## Ingredients
* 4 1/2 tablespoons flour
* 1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
* 1 1/2 cups butter, soft but not melted
* 1 1/2 cups milk
* 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla

## Instructions
Cook flour and milk until very thick - cool. Cream sugar, butter, and vanilla until very light and fluffy. Combine the cream mixture and the flour mixture. Mix until well blended (should be the texture of whipped cream). Frost between layers and on top.
