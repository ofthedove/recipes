<p>I recently saw red beans and rice on reddit and decided I wanted to make some. It happened that we went to Joel and Rachael’s houes the night I was going to make this, so I made it there! (Thia did the prep work for me before we left.) It turned out really well I think.</p>

<p>I was inspired by this Reddit Post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/DixieFood/comments/tqesrs/red_beans_and_rice_forgot_the_green_onions/</p>

<p>That linked to this recipe:
https://www.deepsouthdish.com/2009/10/shortcut-red-beans-rice.html?m=1</p>

<p>I also looked at this recipe:
https://damndelicious.net/2019/04/15/red-beans-and-rice/</p>

<p>Ultimately I didn’t follow either recipe exactly though.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 small pyrex (~1pt I think) chopped onion</li>
  <li>1 small pyrex chopped green onion</li>
  <li>1 small pyrex chopped celery</li>
  <li>A bunch of minced garlic</li>
  <li>1 Squeeze Tomato Paste</li>
  <li>1 pkg Andouille Sausage</li>
  <li>4 cans Red Beans</li>
  <li>Chicken Better than Bouillon</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
  <li>Rice</li>
  <li>Seasonings</li>
  <li>Hot sauce</li>
  <li>Green Onion</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Slice the sausage into thin rings and fry it, just enough to get a little color on it.</p>

<p>Fry the trinity in a little oil. Start the green pepper a little early, it takes longer to cook down.</p>

<p>Add the garlic and tomato paste, cook until fragrent. Quickly add chicken stock or water with bouillon.</p>

<p>Add back the sausage. Drain, rinse, and add the beans. Season to taste with Cajun Seasoning (Or whatever sounds good.)</p>

<p>While the beans simmer and cook-down a little, prepare the rice.</p>

<p>Serve over rice topped with green onion and hot sauce.</p>
