title: Sausage Cheese Muffins
---

This classic savory hand-held breakfast treat is a favorite in our family. Often made around the holidays, it's a great grab-and-go breakfast any time. This is the recipe from the Taste of Home website. We're not sure if this is the exact recipe we've always used, but it's close enough.

## Ingredients
- 1 lb sausage (Purnell's Old Folks Hot or Spicy-Medium)
- 1 cup shredded cheddar 
- 1 can (10.75 oz) condensed cheddar cheese soup, undiluted
- 2/3 cup milk
- 3 cups bisquick

## Instructions
- Fully cook the sausage and drain excess fat (optional? I like fat)
- Combine soup, shredded cheese, and water. Stir in biscuit mix. Add sausage.
- Grease muffin tins, fill to 3/4 full
- Bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean
- Cool 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool
- Serve warm. Stores well in the refrigerator.
