title: Pinto Bean Pie
---

Found on TikTok, this recipe is copied from [ALegumeADay.com](https://alegumeaday.com/pinto-bean-pie/)

I made this for the 2024 Holiday potluck at GE Appliances, mostly for the novelty. It does taste not that different from pumpkin pie, different but still good. The texture is unique though. The bits of bean skin make it pretty grainy.

## Ingredients
- 3 cups cooked pinto beans, drained and rinsed
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup brown sugar, light or dark
- 4 eggs
- 1 cup whole milk
- 2 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp ginger
- ½ tsp cloves
- ½ tsp nutmeg
- 2 Tbs vanilla extract
- ½ tsp salt, or just a pinch if using salted beans
- 2 unbaked 9-inch pie shells (store-bought or homemade)
- Whipped cream, for serving (optional)

## Instructions
1. This recipe uses cooked pinto beans. Cook up a big pot of Nebraska pinto beans and save some to bake this Pinto Bean Pie. It takes about 1 cup to 1 and ½ cups of dry pinto beans to get 3 cups of cooked pinto beans.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (~175 degrees C).
3. In a food processor or blender, cream butter, white sugar, and brown sugar.
4. Add the eggs and blend, scraping down the sides as necessary.
5. Rinse pinto beans and drain well. Add to the food processor/blender with the milk, spices, vanilla, and salt and puree until smooth.
6. Pour the mixture into two 9-inch pie shells and bake until set and starting to turn a golden brown on top, and an inserted knife comes out clean. Baking time varies with oven but will be around 60 – 80 minutes.
7. Let Pinto Bean Pie cool at room temperature, to allow to set.
8. Serve with whipped cream, if desired. Leftovers store well in the refrigerator, in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap and foil.
