This impossibly easy cookie recipe produces amazing, chewy cookies with crisp bottoms and intense flavor.

I was looking for M&M cookie recipes for James for Christmas 2025 and I found [this blog post](https://www.thepancakeprincess.com/best-mm-cookie-bake-off/) comparing a bunch of recipes. I decided to make [this one](https://www.jessiesheehanbakes.com/wprm_print/best-ever-chewy-mm-cookies) because it's fast, easy, and I'm too cheap to pay for NYT cooking.

As far as I can tell there's no real difference between chocolate chip cookies and M&M cookies, I'll likely try this recipe with chocolate chips in the future. I would still like to find a very plain sugar cookie recipe kid-focused M&M cookies, this recipe is great but I think not quite what James was looking for.

## Ingredients
* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
* 12 tablespoons unsalted butter melted
* 1 cup packed light brown sugar
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1 large egg
* 1 yolk
* 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
* 1 1/4 cups M&Ms

## Instructions
* Heat oven to 425°F. If you are planning on making cookies that are not as large as the 1/4 cup called for here, bake at 375. Line baking sheets with parchment paper.
* In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the flour, salt, and baking soda.
* In a large mixing bowl, whisk the melted butter and the sugars until well combined. Whisk in the egg, yolk and vanilla until well combined. With a flexible spatula, gently fold in the dry ingredients until just combined.
* Scoop 1/4 cup balls of dough using an ice cream scoop or dry measuring cup and space the dough balls about 2 in apart on the prepared sheets.
* Bake the cookies, one sheet at a time for about 8 to 10 minutes. Check around half way, if they are browning more quickly than you’d like reduce the temp to 375. Cookies might seem a little light in color at this point.
* Let cool about 5 min before transferring to wire racks or towels, cool completely before storing.

## Notes
- Dough balls can be frozen and baked later. Add a few min to the baking time when baking from frozen
- I tweaked temperature a few times due to the recipe's vagueness. You'll have to watch and adjust to get the browned-to-chewy ratio you want. Good luck 🙃
