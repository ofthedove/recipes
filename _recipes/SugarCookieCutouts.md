The classic sugar cookie decorated every year for Christmas with decorating sugar. The recipe for this classic treat comes straight from the Better Homes and Gardens New Cook Book

## Ingredients
- 2/3 cup butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 egg
- 1 Tablespoon milk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 2 cups AP flour

## Instructions
- Using stand mixer, beat butter on medium to high speed for 30 seconds. Add granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Beat until combined, scraping sides of bowl occasionally. Beat in egg, milk, and vanilla until combined. Beat in as much of the flour as you can with the mixer. Stir in any remaining flour. Divide dough in half. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and chill dough about 30 minutes or until easy to handle.
- Preheat oven to 375F. On a floured surface, and working with half the dough at a time, roll to 1/8-1/4 inch thickness. Using cookie cutters, cut into desired shapes. Remnants can usually be re-rolled once. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Parchment paper recommended.
- Decorate with decorating sugar (also called sanding sugar). Some additional decorations can be used, but be careful, non-purpose-made decorations may melt during baking.
- Bake for 7 to 10 min or until edges are firm and bottoms are very light brown. Transfer cookies to wire racks and let cool.

## Notes
- Dough can be prepared in advance and allowed to remain in refrigerator overnight if needed.
- Cookies can also be baked without sugar and decorated with icing
- For a classic Valentine's day variation, cut out cookies into large heart shapes. Cut small heart-shaped "windows" into half the cut-outs. Place down a solid heart, add a thin layer of strawberry jelly leaving an uncovered margin, then place a heart with a window cut-out on top. Gently press edges and bake as usual.
