Classic family cheesecake recipe. Mom made this for Emily's birthday this year (2023) and didn't have the recipe, but remembered it was the "Dear Abby" recipe. I found it and she confirmed it is the one true canonical cheesecake recipe, so I'm recording it here!

## Ingredients
### Crust
- 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
- 1/2 cup butter, melted (1 stick)
- 1/3 cup powdered sugar
### Filling
- 3 (8 oz) packages cream cheese, softened
- 4 eggs
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 pint dairy sour cream (room temp)

## Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees.

2. Combine graham cracker crumbs, powdered sugar and melted butter. Press into bottom of 8-inch springform pan.

3. In a large bowl, beat cream cheese, eggs, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Pour mixture over prepared crust.

4. Bake at 350 degrees for 50 minutes (until center is set).

5. Remove from oven and spread sour cream on top of cheesecake. Return to oven and bake an additional 5 minutes.

6. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Spread desired topping on cheesecake.

Tip: To minimize cracking, place shallow pan half full of hot water on lower rack of oven during baking. And be sure the sour cream is at room temperature when you spread it on.
