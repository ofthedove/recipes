title: Meatloaf - Mom's Classic
---
Mom's classic meatloaf. It's been a while since I made this so I'm guessing on a lot of this.

## Ingredients
* 2 lb ground beef
* 1 lb hot italian sausage
* 1/3 c oatmeal
* Ketchup
* 1 Egg
* Seasonings

## Instructions
Mix it all together and bake it in a big baking pan. Try to avoid over-mixing, this meatloaf is usually fall-apart-y.
