<p>A classic comfort side dish usually enjoyed at Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. This recipe comes from Mom’s Better Homes and Gardens cook book, with several tweaks. Make sure to check the notes, there are several for this recipe!</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup Elbow Macaroni (4 oz)</li>
  <li>1/4 cup chopped Onion</li>
  <li>1 Tb Butter</li>
  <li>1 Tb AP Flour</li>
  <li>Black Pepper</li>
  <li>1 1/4 cup Milk</li>
  <li>2 cup Cheese (8oz)</li>
  <li>Ritz crackers and butter for topping</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Cook macaroni and drain well
Cook onion in butter till tender but not brown. Stir in flour and seasoning. Add milk all at once. Cook and stir till slightly thickened and bubbly. Add shredded cheese, stir till melted
Stir macaroni into cheese sauce. Transfer to a 1qt casserole. Cover with combination of melted butter and crushed crackers
Bake, uncovered, in a 350 oven for 25 or 30 min or till bubbly.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t make just one! The amounts here will serve only 4. Tripling the recipe should fill a 9x13 casserole, but quadrupling gives better “round” numbers.</li>
  <li>A blend of American, cheddar, and cream cheese is typically used. Even ratio should work well, but can be adjusted depending on how much is being made.</li>
  <li>Try adding dry mustard or nutmeg, or even some hot sauce!</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-bechamel-baked-mac-cheese-recipe">This recipe from Serious Eats</a> is similar, but has several differences. A couple of highlights that could easily be applied here:
    <ul>
      <li>Reserve a portion of the shredded cheese and add it after removing the sauce from the heat to get some stretchy-ness in the final casserole</li>
      <li>Use panko instead of cracker crumbs in the topping for extra crispy goodness</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Serious Eats also has another version of thier recipe using sodium citrate rather than a bechemel, find it <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/sodium-citrate-baked-mac-and-cheese">here</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="easter-2023">Easter 2023</h3>

<p>I made a mac-and-cheese casserole for Easter of 23. I mistakenly thought this recipe and the serious eats recipe were basically the same and kinda combo-ed them, but they’re actually not totally interchangable… Anyway my casserole came out great. I don’t know which recipe I’ll use next time!</p>
