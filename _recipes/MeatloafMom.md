title: Meatloaf - Mom's Classic
---
Mom's classic meatloaf. It's been a while since I made this so I'm guessing on a lot of this.

## Ingredients
- 2 lb ground beef
- 1 lb hot italian sausage
- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 Egg
- 1 c oatmeal
- 1 c Ketchup
- Salt
- Pepper
- Garlic powder

## Instructions
Mix it all together, shape into a loaf, top with additional ketchup, and bake it in a roasting pan. Try to avoid over-mixing, this meatloaf is usually fall-apart-y.

Note: Ingredients are, of course, adjustable to taste.
