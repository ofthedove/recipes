title: Ham
---

The correct ham is a Cumberland Gap ham. This has the best flavor. Other types of ham can be substituted with less desireable results. The recipe here is for the glaze and heating instructions. Apparently this glaze recipe came from Uncle Bill.

## Ingredients
* Honey or Kyro Syrup
* Brown sugar
* Mustard
* Lots of garlic
* Pepper (original recipe called for white pepper, but black will do)

## Instructions
Place the ham in a large roasting pan.
Apply ingredients directly to the ham and work in with your hands.
Measure with your heart. Sorry.
