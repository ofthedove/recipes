<p>Spiced meat stuffed in a pita and grilled.</p>

<p>Based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K45Fr4gXyM">this Internet Shaquille video</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 onion</li>
  <li>Parsley (curly)</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp Cumin</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp coriander</li>
  <li>1 t paprika</li>
  <li>1 t black pepper</li>
  <li>1 Tb seven spice</li>
  <li>Salt</li>
  <li>1 lb Ground Beef</li>
  <li>Pitas</li>
  <li>Oil</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="seven-spice--baharat">Seven Spice / Baharat</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 Tb ground Allspice</li>
  <li>1 1/2 Tb ground Cumin</li>
  <li>1 Tb ground Coriander</li>
  <li>2 t ground Cloves</li>
  <li>2 t ground Nutmeg</li>
  <li>1 1/2 t ground Cinnamon</li>
  <li>1 t Black Pepper</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
<p>Roughly chop the onion and pick the leaves off the parsley. Pu the onion, garlic and parsley leaves in a food processor and process until finely minced. Squeeze to remove excess water from the mixture, either by hand or with cheesecloth. Expect a significant amount of water loss.</p>

<p>Return the onion mixture to the bowl of the food processor and add the spices and salt. Seven spice blend can me made using the ingredients above if you’re unable to find it. Note that the amounts shown above create 5 or 6 times more than what’s needed for a single recipe.</p>

<p>Procecss to combine. Add the meat (and optionally bread crumbs) and process again until combined. Cut the pitas in half and open the “pockets.” Stuff the meat into the pitas, aiming for about a 1 cm thick layer of meat. This thin layer is important to ensure quick and even cooking.</p>

<p>Lightly oil the surface of the pita to improve browning and prevent dryness. Cook, ideally on the grill but a skillet or oven can be used. Cook until the meat is well done and the pita is nicely browned and crispy.</p>

<p>Serve hot, alone or with a yogurt based sauce.</p>

## Makes

### May 5, 2024

I made these for the first time May 5, 2024. Because salt isn't listed in the spice blends, I forgot to add it. That was a big oopsie. I also scaled up the recipe for 1 1/2 - 2 lb of beef, and added a second onion and breadcrumbs, but forgot to double the spice mixture so they came out rather bland. Texturally I really liked it though, the worked beef is a little bouncy and the pitas were nicely browned.

I served with Tzatziki (greek yogurt, dill, lemon juice, cucumber, and watermelon rind (I had it okay)) and a quick salad of cucumber, tomato, parsley, and olive oil. Also fresh fruit.

I'd like to make it again some time and season it propperly. I think my pitas were also a little smaller than shown in the video, I ended up with 12 portions (6 pitas cut in half) and enough meat mix left for two more. We had family over and it was a great way to feed a crowd. Of course, we also did quesadillas with just salt and pepper beef and cheese on mini corn tortillas on the grill and honestly those were better. Grilled corn tortilla is just so good. But mostly salt makes a huge difference.
