# Chicken Casserole
Mom's famous chicken casserole recipe. The recipe she sent me calls it "Hot Chicken Salad". Mom serves it with rice.

## Ingredients
- 2 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 2 bay leaves
- 4 cups diced celery
- 1 can (10-3/4 oz) condensed cream of chicken soup, undiluted
- 2 cups mayonnaise
- 2 cups (16 oz) sour cream
- 2 cans (8 oz ea) water chestnuts, drained
- 1 can (8 oz) mushroom stems and pieces, drained
- 1 cup slivered almonds
- 2 tablespoons chopped onion
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 2 cups (8 oz) shredded cheddar cheese
- 2 cans (2.8 oz each) french-fried onions

## Instructions
Place chicken in a dutch oven and cover with water; add bay leaves. Bring to a boil. Cook, uncovered, until juices run clear. Remove chicken and cut into 1/2-in cubes; place in a large bowl. Add the next 11 ingredients. Transfer to a 13-in x 9-in

Note: That's all of the recipe Mom sent me. You can probably figure the rest out on your own though. Maybe after I make it I'll come back and update this. Maybe.
