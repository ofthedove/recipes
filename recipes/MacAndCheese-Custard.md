# Macaroni and Cheese
This is the Serious Eats Food Lab macaroni and cheese from here: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/10/the-food-labs-ultra-gooey-stovetop-mac-cheese.html
It's simpler than a bechamel mac and cheese, but not quite as simple as the one-pot recipies from food lab and food wishes
I made this one for Trigger Tuesday one time and it worked well.

I also made it recently with some modifications. I made just the cheese sauce seperate from the noodles, so I could put some on noodles and some on rice. Both were good, but it got just a little grainy. I assume mixing it with the noodles in helps control temp a little better. Also, I left out the mustard and hotsauce, and used 18oz colby jack + 6oz sharp cheddar, and didn't end up adding the cornstarch.

## Ingredients
* 1 pound elbow macaroni
* Kosher salt
* One 12-ounce can evaporated milk
* 2 large eggs
* 1 teaspoon Frankâ€™s RedHot or other hot sauce
* 1 teaspoon ground mustard
* 1 pound extra-sharp cheddar, grated (see note)
* 8 ounces American cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (see note)
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 4 chunks

## Instructions
Cook macaroni al dente, as directed on macaroni package

Whisk together the evaporated milk, eggs, hot sauce, and mustard in a bowl until homogeneous. Toss the cheeses with the cornstarch in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.

When the pasta is cooked, drain it and return it to the saucepan. Place over low heat, add the butter, and stir until melted. Add the milk mixture and cheese mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheese is completely melted and the mixture is hot and creamy. Season to taste with salt and more hot sauce. Serve immediately, topping with toasted bread crumbs if desired.
