# Biscuits (Flaky)
These biscuits are a bit more work than my easy biscuits, but are very rewarding.

## Ingredients
- 8.5 oz Self Rising Flour (Soft winter wheat flour, such as White Lily)
- 1 stick butter (frozen)
- 3/4 cups buttermilk
- pinch of salt (optional)
- pinch of sugar (optional)

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 450

Combine flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor

Cut butter into manageable pieces (~1/2 tablespoon) and spread into bowl of food processor

Process butter into flour until no large chunks of butter remain, consistency should be similar to cornmeal

Add buttermilk, process just until combined

Turn out onto floured work surface. Quickly bring dough together with floured hands

Roll out dough with floured rolling pin, then fold in thirds. Repeat 4-5 more times 

When dough begins to resist rolling, fold it in half and roll to final thickness.

(Should be just a little rolling in this step, a defined split will help the biscuits pull apart evenly when done)

Cut straight down with biscuit cutter and place biscuits onto parchment paper lined baking sheet

(Extra dough can be formed into biscuit shapes and also baked. These won't be as flaky, but still good!)

Bake for ~12 min, until golden brown on top. 

### Notes

Freeze food processor blade and butter, and chill flour and buttermilk in advance for best results.

Work quickly and avoid touching dough excessively. (To avoid heating it.)
