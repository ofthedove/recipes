title: Lemon Meringue Pie
---

Mom's classic Lemon Meringue Pie recipe, from the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook.

I've adapted it, adding details from my most recent time making it. It's probably too much detail, I'm afraid I've made it a bit intimidating. I assure you it's really not difficult to make, and it's very tasty!

## Ingredients

### Crust

* 1 9 inch pie crust, make or buy

### Filling

* 1 1/2 c Sugar
* 3 Tbsp AP Flour
* 3 Tbsp Cornstarch
* 4 egg yolks
* 2 Tbsp butter
* Lemon Zest
* 1/3 c Lemon Juice

### Meringue

* 4 Egg Whites (room temperature)
* 1 tsp Vanilla Extract
* 1/2 tsp Cream of Tarter
* 6 Tbsp Sugar

## Instructions

The crust should be prepared first. Ideally, the filling and meringue are prepared at the same time, but this requires assistance. When working alone, lay out ingredients for both, prepare the meringue first, then quickly follow with the custard. The meringue should be placed over the custard while it's still quite hot so that the heat of the custard aids in cooking the meringue.

### Crust

Blind bake the crust.

Preheat the oven to 425. Place a 9 inch pie crust in a 9 inch pie pan. Prick the bottom with a fork at half inch intervals. Place parchment paper or aluminum foil over the crust, making sure to cover the edges to prevent burning and aid release. Fill with rice, beans, pie weights, etc. Bake on the lowest position for 15 minutes. Reduce the temp to 375, remove the weights and cover, and bake another 5 minutes or until brown. Remove and cool.

### Prep

In a medium saucepan combine sugar, flour, cornstarch, and a dash of salt. Gradually stir in 1 1/2 cups water. Set aside.

Zest and juice several lemons. The exact number of lemons needed will vary with the size and quality of lemons used. In the most recent preparation, the zest and juice of two lemons were used. With zest, more is better, assuming you like a very lemon-y filling. The juice should be measured to 1/3 cup with some precision to avoid affecting the consistency.

Separate egg whites and yolks, placing the whites in the bowl of a stand mixer and the yolks in a small bowl. Beat the yolks together.

### Meringue

Add the vanilla and cream of tarter to the egg whites. Beat together until soft peaks form. While beating at high speed, gradually add sugar, one tablespoon at a time, until stiff, glossy peaks and sugar dissolves.

### Filling

Place the medium saucepan over medium high heat, stirring, until thick and bubbly. Reduce the heat and cook, stirring, another two minutes. Remove from heat. Using about one cup of the hot filling, temper and then add the egg yolks. Return to the heat and bring to a gentle boil, then cook for two more minutes. Remove from heat and add the butter and lemon peel. Stir in lemon juice, incorporating fully.

### Assembly

Pour the filling into the pie crust. Immediately spread meringue over the hot filling. Be sure to seal the meringue to the edges, so that it doesn't shrink during baking.

Bake the pie in a 350 degree oven fot 12-15 minutes, just until the meringue is golden. Cool thoroughly, 4 to 6 hours. Store in the fridge, covered in plastic wrap. Use toothpicks to prevent the plastic wrap from touching meringue directly. Dip knife in water when cutting to avoid sticking.
