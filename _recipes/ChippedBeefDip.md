title: Chipped Beef Dip
---

I kinda got this from a website, but the website was pretty awful so I don't feel like linking it here. Also I adapted it, cause the website tried to overcomplicate it and make it pretentious.

## Ingredients
- 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 8 ounces sour cream
- a few good shakes Worcestershire sauce
- a careful shake garlic powder
- 1 glass "juice glass" jar of thin beef slice things
- a heap of green onions, sliced

## Instructions
- Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
- Put everything in a bowl and mix it up.
- Place in pie plate and bake for 20-30 minutes or until dip is hot and bubbly.
- Optionally, brefily broil till small browned/blackended spots form.
