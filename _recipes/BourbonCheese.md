title: Bourbon Cheese
---

Feel free to play with the spices on this one. I usually taste and adjust several times before I call it done. Also, this is most easily made in a food processor, but you can do it with a mixer too. Letting it sit for a day or two will smooth it out a lot.

## Ingredients
- 2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese
- 4 cups shredded medium sharp cheddar
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp onion powder
- 2 TB Kentucky bourbon
- 1/2 tsp hot sauce

## Instructions
Add shredded Monterey Jack, shredded cheddar, 1/2 cup sour cream, and mayonnaise. Process until mixture forms a ball. Add the rest of the sour cream, smoked paprika, minced garlic, onion powder, bourbon, and hot sauce.  Process again until mixture is smooth.
