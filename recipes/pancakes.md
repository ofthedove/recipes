# Pancakes
Babish's Recipe for Pancakes. From his Twin Peaks video, copied crom [here](https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/2017/5/18/buttermilk-pancakes-inspired-by-twin-peaks?rq=pancake) for printing. Made these once but didn't do it quite right, I was in a rush. It was alright, I'd like to try again with more time.

## Ingredients
* 7 ounces all purpose flour
* 2 Tbsp sugar
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 2 cups buttermilk (plus more as needed)
* 1 large egg
* 3 Tbsp melted butter, cooled (plus more for plating)
* 1 Tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 large hamsteak
* Warm maple syrup

## Instructions
Makes 6-8 large pancakes

In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and kosher salt.  In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk, egg, and melted butter.  Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients, pour the buttermilk mixture into it, and gently whisk until just combined - batter should still be lumpy.  Cover and let rest in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes.

Spray a large cast iron or nonstick skillet with nonstick spray, and heat over medium-low heat, increasing to medium heat after 5 minutes.  Pour 1/8-1/4 cup batter (depending on how large you want your pancakes) onto the griddle, and cook for 1-3 minutes.  Once the edges of the pancake become dull and bubbles/holes form on the top of the pancake, check to make sure the bottom is brown, and flip, cooking for another 1-2 minutes.  If desired, place on a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet in a low (250Â°F) oven to keep warm.

While pancakes cook, preheat vegetable oil over medium heat in a nonstick skillet, and fry hamsteak until browned and heated through.  Serve both with warm maple syrup and melted butter.  And coffee, of course.
