<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/Biscuits_Easy.html">
      Biscuits (Easy)
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>These biscuits are dead easy and can be made in any quantity, even just one biscuit!
I hear they’re really easy to modify too, such as by adding cheese or sugar, but I haven’t tried myself yet.</p>
</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/Biscuits_Flaky.html">
      Biscuits (Flaky)
    </a>

      Bourbon Cheese
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>Feel free to play with the spices on this one. I usually taste and adjust several times before I call it done. Also, this is most easily made in a food processor, but you can do it with a mixer too. Letting it sit for a day or two will smooth it out a lot.</p>
</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/BreakfastCasserole.html">
      Breakfast Casserole
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>The classic Christmas morning casserole, plus some variations. The base recipe is very similar to <a href="/recipes/recipes/HashbrownCasserole.html">Hashbrown Casserole</a></p>

      Carnitas
    </a>

<p><p>Classic family cheesecake recipe. Mom made this for Emily’s birthday this year (2023) and didn’t have the recipe, but remembered it was the “Dear Abby” recipe. I found it and she confirmed it is the one true canonical cheesecake recipe, so I’m recording it here!</p>
</p>

<h3>

      Cheesecake (AB)
    </a>

</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/ChippedBeefDip.html">
      Chipped Beef Dip
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>I kinda got this from a website, but the website was pretty awful so I don’t feel like linking it here. Also I adapted it, cause the website tried to overcomplicate it and make it pretentious.</p>
</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/ChocolateChipPie.html">
      Chocolate Chip Pie
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>This incredibly chocolatey, rich pie is my favorite pie, and a great choice for Thanksgiving or any celebration.</p>

      Cooked Icing
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>This classic tops every properly prepared red velvet cake</p>
</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/Cornbread.html">
      Cornbread
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>Adam Ragusea’s recipe from YouTube. Gonna try it, figure I should write it down first.
Made it. It’s very good, it’s moist! Def on the sweet side, and too much for just me.</p>

</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/EnchiladaSoup.html">
      Enchilada Soup
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>This started as a harebrained experiment but it turned out really nice, Thia liked it, and I expect I’ll make it again. It’s not too far off of Chicken Tortilla Soup, though it’s been so long now I couldn’t tell you how close it is exactly.</p>
</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/Ham.html">
      Ham
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>The correct ham is a Cumberland Gap ham. This has the best flavor. Other types of ham can be substituted with less desireable results. The recipe here is for the glaze and heating instructions. Apparently this glaze recipe came from Uncle Bill.</p>

It’s simpler than a bechamel mac and cheese, but not quite as simple as the one-pot recipies from food lab and food wishes
I made this one for Trigger Tuesday one time and it worked well.</p>
</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/MacNCheeseCasserole.html">

</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/MoistGarlicChicken.html">
      Moist Garlic Chicken
    </a>
  </h3>
<p><p>I’m afraid this “recipe” is very basic and will take some interpretation to replicate. It’s pretty hard to mess up. Good luck!</p>
</p>
