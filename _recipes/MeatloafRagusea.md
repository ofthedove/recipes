I've never actually made this, but I would like to try it some time. Seems like a good recipe, lots of veggies which I've not tried before

## Ingredients
- 2 lbs (1 kg) ground meat, I like beef chuck + lamb
- 1/2-1 (50-100g) cup bread crumbs
- 4 carrots
- 1 onion
- 2 egg yolks (or one whole egg)
- fresh rosemary and/or thyme
- milk
- garlic powder
- salt
- pepper
- oil
- ketchup
- Worcestershire sauce

## Instructions
Grate the carrots and onion into an oven-safe pan, ideally non-stick. Add some oil and cook the vegetable on high heat until softened, about 8 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Put in the breadcrumbs and stir in just as much milk as they will absorb.

While the pan cools down, get your oven heating to 350 F /180 C. Mix up the glaze in a bowl by combining about 3/4 cup (180 ml) ketchup with an equal quantity of Worcestershire sauce.

Put the meat in the pan, along with about a teaspoon of garlic powder, 2-3 teaspoons salt, lots of pepper, some fresh rosemary and/or thyme, about four spoonfuls of the glaze, and the egg. Mix with your hands until the mixture is homogenous.

In the same pan, shape the mixture into a loaf a little taller than you want it (it will spread a bit in the oven) and coat it with half of the remaining glaze before putting in the oven. After about a half hour, coat it with the remaining glaze. Cook until the internal temperature is 160 F / 70 C. At the last minute, turn on the broiler to get some extra color on the glaze, but take it out before it burns.

Let rest for at least 10 minutes before removing from the pan and slicing.
