title: Meatloaf - Glazed
---
This is NOT Mom's meatloaf, but it's good. Firmer, didn't fall apart, but wasn't dry either.

I made one when Sara and Allison were over and it turned out really well. I also made it for Caleb's birthday 2023 and it was well received.

It held it's shape nicely even when cut, but it wasn't dry. There wasn't much grease in the pan. It was especially good for sandwiches because of how it held together. 

I really liked the sauce, it was just a homemade BBQ but it was good. I tried to be really generous with the sauce but there was still a lot extra that got thrown away, not many people wanted more at the table.

I've tried with plain ground pork and with Italian sausage. Both were good. Hot sausage does kinda steal the stage flavor wise. I may try all-beef in the future if it's still cheaper than pork mix.

I learned this recipe from this YouTube video from the channel Brian Lagerstrom: [youtube.com/watch?v=3eGyG2hLmy8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eGyG2hLmy8)

## Meatloaf
### Ingredients
- Olive oil 
- 150g or 1 large onion (small diced)
- Salt
- 75g or 1 1/2c panko breadcrumbs 
- 85g or 1/3c buttermilk
- 450g or 1lb 90/10 ground beef
- 450g or 1lb 90/10 ground pork 
- 2 eggs + 1 yolk
- 3 cloves garlic, finely minced
- 15g or 1Tbsp worcestershire 
- 15g or 1Tbsp dijon mustard
- 2g 1 1/4tsp poultry seasoning 
- 3g or 1 1/3tsp black pepper 
- 12g or 2tsp salt 

### Instructions
Preheat medium saute pan over medium, add a long squeeze of olive oil, followed by onions and a pinch of salt. Stir and cook until softened, about 5min. Move onions to a bowl and set aside. 

In a food processor, add breadcrumbs. Spin to break down until powdery. Add buttermilk then spin for 10 seconds or until mixture is hydrated. Add ground meats and process to combine and break down meat, about 15sec. 

Transfer meat mixture to onion bowl and add eggs, garlic, worcestershire, mustard, poultry seasoning, pepper, and salt. Mix and fold until just combined. 

Shape into a loaf. I use a loaf pan to shape it, then transfer out onto a foil lined baking tray. 
Refrigerate for about 10-15min while you make the glaze. 


Sear meat loaf under medium-low broiler for 5-10min until beginning to take on color on top. Add a layer of glaze (recipe below) and return to cook under broiler for another 3min. When glaze gets sticky and begins to take on color, remove loaf from oven and glaze again. Return to oven under broiler and repeat, rotating as necessary. 

Glaze a third/final time then load into a 325F/160C to bake for 25-35min or until internal temp reaches 155F/70C

## Glaze
### Ingredients
- 60g or 1/3c brown sugar 
- 40g 2 2/3Tbsp cider vinegar 
- 10g or about 1/3Tbsp worcestershire
- 20g 1 1/4Tbsp sriracha 
- 300g or 1 1/4c ketchup 

### Instructions
Add ingredients to small sauce pot and stir. Once meatloaf has been glazed three times and is baking (see recipe above), place over medium low heat to reduce by half, about 3-4min Stir often to prevent burning. 

## Onion Gravy
### Ingredients
- 50g or 3 1/2Tbsp butter  
- 100g or 2c onion, medium diced 
- salt
- 25g or 3 1/4Tbsp AP flour 
- 450g or 1 Â¾-2c beef stock 
- 10g or 1Tbsp beef flavored better than bouillon 
- 5g or 1tsp soy sauce 

### Instructions
Preheat saute pan over medium heat. Add butter, onion, and a pinch of salt. Sweat for about 5min to soften. Add flour and whisk to combine and cook for 3-5min. Whisk in 100g of the beef stock. When stirred in and thickening, whisk in remaining 350g stock. When simmering, add bouillon past and soy sauce. Simmer for about 5min or until thickened and onions are fully softened.
