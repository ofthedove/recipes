      Biscuits (Easy)
    </a>
  </h3>

<p><p>These biscuits are dead easy and can be made in any quantity, even just one biscuit!

      Bourbon Cheese
    </a>
  </h3>

<p><p>Feel free to play with the spices on this one. I usually taste and adjust several times before I call it done. Also, this is most easily made in a food processor, but you can do it with a mixer too. Letting it sit for a day or two will smooth it out a lot.</p>
</p>

      Chipped Beef Dip
    </a>
  </h3>

<p><p>I kinda got this from a website, but the website was pretty awful so I don’t feel like linking it here. Also I adapted it, cause the website tried to overcomplicate it and make it pretentious.</p>
</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/ChocolateChipPie.html">
      Chocolate Chip Pie
    </a>
  </h3>

<p><p>This incredibly chocolatey, rich pie is my favorite pie, and a great choice for Thanksgiving or any celebration.</p>

</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/EnchiladaSoup.html">
      Enchilada Soup
    </a>
  </h3>

<p><p>This started as a harebrained experiment but it turned out really nice, Thia liked it, and I expect I’ll make it again. It’s not too far off of Chicken Tortilla Soup, though it’s been so long now I couldn’t tell you how close it is exactly.</p>
</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/Ham.html">
      Ham
    </a>

</p>

<h3>
    <a href="/recipes/recipes/MoistGarlicChicken.html">
      Moist Garlic Chicken
    </a>
