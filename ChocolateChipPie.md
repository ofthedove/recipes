# Chocolate Chip Pie
This incredibly chocolatey, rich pie is my favorite pie, and a great choice for Thanksgiving or any celebration.

## Ingredients
* 1 9-inch unbaked deep-dish pie shell (4-cup volume)
* 2 large eggs
* 1/2 cup AP flour
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 3/4 cup butter, softened
* 1 cup chopped nuts

## Instructions
Preheat oven to 325
Beat eggs in large mixer bowl on high speed until foamy. Beat in flour, granulated sugar, and brown sugar. Beat in butter. Stir in morsels and nuts. Spoon into pie shell.
Bake for 55 to 60 minutes or until knife inserted halfway between edge and center comes out clean. Cool on wire rack. Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream, if desired.
