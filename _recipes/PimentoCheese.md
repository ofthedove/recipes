title: Pimento Cheese
---

Great on a sandwich or with crackers. A perfect accompaniment for chili, but great on it's own too. Makes a fantastic, though somewhat runny grilled cheese.

## Ingredients
- 1 can Diced Pimentos
- 1 block Cream Cheese
- 1/2 C Mayo
- 2 C Shredded Cheese
- Seasonings

## Instructions
Mix everything together and season to taste.

Seasoning options:
- Salt
- Pepper
- Garlic Powder
- Onion Powder
- Cayeene
- Smoked Paprika
- Worcestershire

Fresh grated block of cheese is better than pre-grated. Sharp cheddar is good but you can use whatever.
