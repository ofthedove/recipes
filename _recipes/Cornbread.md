Adam Ragusea's recipe from YouTube. Gonna try it, figure I should write it down first.
Made it. It's very good, it's moist! Def on the sweet side, and too much for just me.

## Ingredients
* 1 Egg
* 1/3 c Veg Oil
* 3/4 c Sugar
* 1 c Milk
* 1 c Flour
* 3/4 teaspoon Salt
* 1 heaped Tablespoon Baking Powder
* 1 c Cornmeal (fine ground, not stone ground)
* 1 Tablespoon *Unsalted* Butter

## Instructions
Use a heavy skillet. Preheat pan in oven to 400F.
Whisk together egg and oil. Whisk in sugar and milk. Whisk in flour. Whisk in salt, baking powder, and corn meal just till smooth.

Remove skillet from oven. Quickly add butter. Use paper towel to grease sides and absorb excess butter. Pour in batter.

Cook in oven for 20-25 min. Will rise and crack when near done. Be conservative with bake time. Remove when toothpick comes out clean.

Let sit for several minutes. Turn out onto plate, then cooling rack. (So as to be right side up on rack)

Let cool at least 10 minutes.


Can be baked in muffin tins instead. Be sure to preheat. Use cooking spray instead of butter
